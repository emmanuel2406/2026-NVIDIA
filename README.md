## 🚀 Our Approach

### Problem Understanding

The LABS problem seeks binary sequences that minimize autocorrelation sidelobes - critical for radar and telecommunications applications. We tackled this NP-hard optimization problem by:

**[Describe your team's high-level strategy]**

Example:
- ✅ Starting with classical Memetic Tabu Search (MTS) baseline
- ✅ Implementing QAOA-based quantum enhancement for population seeding
- ✅ GPU-accelerating both quantum simulation and classical search
- ✅ Benchmarking across multiple NVIDIA GPU architectures

### Why This Approach?

**[Explain your reasoning for choosing your specific quantum algorithm and hybrid strategy]**

Example:
- QAOA provides variational flexibility for combinatorial problems
- Quantum seeding can explore solution space more efficiently than random initialization
- GPU acceleration critical for scaling to larger sequence lengths
